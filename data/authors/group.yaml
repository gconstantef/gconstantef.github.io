  Welcome! We are a research group in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. Our work focuses on the development of **data-driven and model-based theory, algorithms, and computational tools** at the intersection of **optimization, machine learning, and energy systems**. We study **large-scale decision-making problems under uncertainty**, motivated by challenges in **power system operation, planning, and market design**, while developing methods that are broadly applicable across diverse scientific and industrial domains.
