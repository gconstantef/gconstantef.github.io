  Welcome! We are a research group in the Department of Electrical, Computer, 
  and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. Our work focuses on 
  the development of **data-driven and model-based theory, algorithms, and computational tools** 
  for large-scale decision-making under uncertainty, at the intersection of optimization 
  and machine learning. Our work is motivated by challenges in power and energy systems, while
  the theory and tools we develop are designed to be broadly applicable across complex engineered 
  and socio-technical systems, including supply chains, infrastructure networks, and operations problems.
