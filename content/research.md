        My research develops **models, theory, and algorithms** for for the **reliable, economical, and resilient operation and planning of large-scale energy systems**. The work lies at the intersection of **power systems, mathematical optimization, and machine learning**, with an emphasis on models that remain grounded in **physical and operational realities**.
        Below are two main research directions. I am currently building dedicated project pages for selected topics and will add figures and short summaries here soon.

      title: 'Power and Energy Systems'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        This research area focuses on improving the **operation, planning, and resilience of electric power systems** in the presence of increasing uncertainty and structural change. We study how **flexibility from a wide range of resources**, including energy storage, flexible industrial loads, buildings, and data centers, can be systematically integrated into grid operations to enhance performance and robustness.
        A key objective is enabling power systems to accommodate **high penetrations of renewable generation** while maintaining reliability across normal and stressed operating conditions. Beyond day-to-day operations, this work examines how flexible resources can mitigate the impact of **extreme events**, such as severe weather, cascading outages, and cyber-physical disturbances.
        Methodologically, we develop **optimization and control formulations** that combine **physical network constraints** with **market mechanisms operating across multiple time scales**, from day-ahead scheduling to real-time dispatch and ancillary services. These models are used to study **operational strategies, investment decisions, and siting problems**, and are evaluated using **high-fidelity simulations** based on detailed grid models and real system data.

      title: 'Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        This research direction explores **machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques** for **decision-making in large-scale, constrained engineering systems**. Rather than focusing solely on predictive accuracy, the emphasis is on learning models that are **directly aligned with downstream optimization, control, and planning objectives**.
        We develop **decision-focused and optimization-aware learning methods** that embed **physical constraints, feasibility requirements, and economic structure** into the learning process. This includes architectures that incorporate **convex approximations, physics-informed constraints, and uncertainty representations** to ensure that learned outputs can be safely and effectively used in operational settings.
        These approaches aim to deliver **fast, interpretable, and reliable decision policies** for problems where classical optimization may be computationally expensive or insufficiently adaptive on its own. Applications include **power system operations and planning**, **stochastic and robust optimization**, and **real-time control under uncertainty**, with the broader goal of **augmenting or replacing complex optimization models** while preserving their essential structural guarantees.
