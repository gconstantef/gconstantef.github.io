        Our research develops optimization and learning methods for reliable, economical, and sustainable power-system operation and planning.
        Current themes include:
        - **Power systems optimization** (AC/DC-OPF, unit commitment, security constraints, decomposition and large-scale algorithms)
        - **Decision-focused learning** and **learning-augmented optimization** (models that respect physics and operational constraints)
        - **Uncertainty-aware operations** (robust and stochastic optimization, recourse approximations)

        I’m currently building visual “project pages” for selected research directions and will add figures and short summaries here soon.
